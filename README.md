# uni-slip-box

A toy project to practice webdev skills. This project is supposed to be a slip-box (aka Zettelkasten) with the main idea of sharing knowledge and ensuring that these notes stay consistent (hence the name universal slip-box). Inspired by the slip-box method (of course), Notion and [A. Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).
